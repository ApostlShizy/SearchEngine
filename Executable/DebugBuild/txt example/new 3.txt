The chestnut-naped antpitta (Grallaria nuchalis) is a species of bird in the antpitta family, Grallariidae. Found in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, it inhabits bamboo stands in temperate to humid montane forest, and in the undergrowth of adjacent forest that lacks bamboo, at elevations between 2,000 and 3,000 metres (6,600 and 9,800 feet). It is known to feed on insects and other invertebrates, and sings mostly at dawn and dusk, usually from a hidden low perch. This chestnut-naped antpitta of the subspecies G. n. ruficeps was photographed in Las T?ngaras, a nature reserve in Choc? Department, Colombia.
